# My-Portfolio
✨ Exciting News! I’ve officially launched my personal portfolio website! 🎉

This website is more than just a collection of pages — it's a reflection of my journey as a Computer Science student, a curious problem-solver, and a passionate tech enthusiast.

📌 What you’ll find inside:
• A curated collection of my academic & personal projects
• Smart systems like a voting system, a tic-tac-toe game, and more
• Insights into my skills in HTML, CSS, Python, Java, C++, and AI
• My research interests, goals, and vision for tech-driven impact
• A glimpse into my creative side, from design to development

🧠 Whether you’re a recruiter, fellow student, or tech professional — I’d love for you to explore it and share your thoughts. Every line of code, every idea, and every feature is a step in my learning journey. Your feedback would mean the world!

🛠️ Why a portfolio?
Because a resume tells... but a portfolio shows. It's my way of bringing my passion to life, sharing what I’ve built, and staying accountable as I grow.

Let’s connect, inspire, and create meaningful change through tech! 🌱
